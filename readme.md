# public transport falsehoods

> *This collection was inspired by other [falsehood collections](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) - curated lists of falsehoods programmers believe in.*

With some experience in reviewing or writing public transport APIs and working with data coming from [a variety of public transport operators](https://github.com/public-transport/european-transport-operators), one comes to experience the wild west of edge cases.

This list aims to raise awareness for some of these quirks both with newcomers as well as people who already spent some time thinking about public transportation - there is always something weird you didn't see yet, after all!

If you know of any falsehoods that are not included below, you're very much encouraged to contribute, have a look at the [contributing](#contributing) section of this page!
